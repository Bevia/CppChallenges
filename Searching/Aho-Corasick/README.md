The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a powerful and efficient algorithm used for multi-pattern string searching. 
It allows you to find occurrences of multiple keywords in a given text in linear time, 
making it very useful for tasks like text analysis, searching in DNA sequences, or network intrusion detection.

The algorithm constructs a trie (prefix tree) from the set of keywords and 
adds "failure links" to facilitate efficient searching. These failure links ensure 
that when a mismatch occurs, the algorithm quickly transitions to the next possible 
state without starting over from the root of the trie.
