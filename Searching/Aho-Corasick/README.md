## Theory

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a powerful and efficient algorithm used for multi-pattern string searching. 
It allows you to find occurrences of multiple keywords in a given text in linear time, 
making it very useful for tasks like text analysis, searching in DNA sequences, or network intrusion detection.

The algorithm constructs a trie (prefix tree) from the set of keywords and 
adds "failure links" to facilitate efficient searching. These failure links ensure 
that when a mismatch occurs, the algorithm quickly transitions to the next possible 
state without starting over from the root of the trie.

## How It Works:
Adding Words to the Trie:
The addWord() method builds a trie structure for the keywords.
Building Failure Links:
The build() method uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to create failure links and combine outputs from the fail links.
Searching:
The search() method processes the input text character by character, using the trie and failure links to find matches efficiently.
Output Example:
For the text "ushers" and the keywords ["he", "she", "his", "hers"], the output will be:

Found 'she' at index 2
Found 'he' at index 3
Found 'hers' at index 1

## Applications
The Aho-Corasick algorithm falls under the category of string searching algorithms. 
Specifically, it is a pattern matching algorithm designed for multi-pattern searching 
within a single pass through the text. Here's how it fits into broader categories:

### Algorithm Design Paradigm:

It is primarily considered a finite-state automaton-based algorithm, 
as it uses a trie structure and incorporates failure links to transition efficiently between states.

### Applications:

This algorithm is widely used in:
	1. Text processing (e.g., keyword searches).
	2. Bioinformatics (e.g., searching DNA sequences).
	3. Network security (e.g., detecting malware signatures).
	4. Natural language processing (e.g., matching words in large corpora).

### Complexity:

It exhibits linear time complexity, which is O(n + m + k), where: 
ùëõ: Length of the text.
ùëö: Total length of all keywords.
ùëò: Number of occurrences found.

This efficiency makes it stand out compared to other searching algorithms, 
particularly in scenarios with multiple patterns.
