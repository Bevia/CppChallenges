## Binary Search Algorithm

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, reducing the size of the problem in each step. Here’s how it works:

	1.	Start: Look at the middle element of the sorted array.
	2.	Comparison: If the middle element matches the target, you’re done.
	3.	Divide: If the target is less than the middle element, search the left half of the array; if it’s greater, search the right half.
	4.	Repeat: Continue this process until the target is found or the search space is empty.

The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), which is much faster than linear search (O(n)) for large datasets, but it requires the input array to be sorted.

This is a fundamental algorithm used in many applications, such as finding elements in databases, search engines, and other optimized search processes.
