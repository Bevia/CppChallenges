Here are three small, beginner-friendly AI projects that we will be working on to learn the fundamentals of artificial intelligence:

1. Image Classification with Neural Networks

	•	Description: Build a simple image classifier using a neural network. You can use a dataset like CIFAR-10 or MNIST (a dataset of hand-written digits) and train a model to classify images.
	•	Learning Goals:
	•	Learn how neural networks work.
	•	Understand the basics of image processing and classification.
	•	Work with a machine learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Load the dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or MNIST).
	2.	Preprocess the images (e.g., normalization, resizing).
	3.	Build a neural network model using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
	4.	Train the model and evaluate its performance.
	•	Extensions: Try to improve the model’s accuracy with techniques like data augmentation or fine-tuning.

2. Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

	•	Description: Create a basic chatbot using natural language processing (NLP). The chatbot can respond to user input by recognizing simple patterns or using pre-defined responses.
	•	Learning Goals:
	•	Understand basic NLP concepts like tokenization and text preprocessing.
	•	Learn how to build conversational AI using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or Transformers.
	•	Get familiar with sequence models like LSTM or Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT).
	•	Steps:
	1.	Decide the chatbot’s purpose (e.g., answering FAQs, weather information).
	2.	Preprocess user input (e.g., tokenize text, remove stop words).
	3.	Implement a response mechanism using rule-based logic or a pre-trained model.
	4.	Evaluate and test the chatbot’s responses.
	•	Extensions: Use a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3) to generate more advanced, dynamic responses.

3. Predict House Prices Using Regression

	•	Description: Build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features like the number of bedrooms, location, and square footage. Use a dataset such as the Boston Housing Dataset or Kaggle House Prices Dataset.
	•	Learning Goals:
	•	Learn about supervised learning and regression algorithms.
	•	Understand feature engineering and model evaluation.
	•	Get experience with libraries like Scikit-Learn.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Load and explore the dataset.
	2.	Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, scale features).
	3.	Train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree).
	4.	Evaluate the model using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).
	•	Extensions: Experiment with more complex models like random forests or gradient boosting to improve predictions.

These projects will give you hands-on experience with different aspects of AI, including neural networks, NLP, and machine learning algorithms.
