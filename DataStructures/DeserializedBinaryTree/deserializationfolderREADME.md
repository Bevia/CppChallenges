Root
├── Folder1
│   ├── File1.txt
│   └── Folder2
│       └── File2.txt
└── File3.txt

n this example:

	•	The root node represents the root directory of the file system.
	•	Folder1 is a subdirectory under the root.
	•	File1.txt is a file in Folder1.
	•	Folder2 is a subdirectory within Folder1.
	•	File2.txt is a file in Folder2.
	•	File3.txt is a file directly under the root.

How Serialization and Deserialization Apply

Serialization (Saving the File System):

To persist this file system structure, you serialize the tree into a format that can be stored. This involves converting the tree into a linear format, often using pre-order traversal. Here’s a possible serialized representation:

Root Folder1 File1.txt # # Folder2 File2.txt # # # File3.txt # #

In this serialized string:

	•	Each folder and file is listed in the order they are visited (pre-order traversal).
	•	# represents null or empty children (e.g., when a node has no further subfolders or files).

You would save this serialized string to a file or database.

Deserialization (Loading the File System):

When you need to reload the file system, you read the serialized string and deserialize it to reconstruct the tree. This process involves parsing the string and building the tree structure according to the serialized data.

Practical Uses for Storing a File System Tree:

	1.	File System Backup:
	•	Goal: Preserve the current state of the file system.
	•	How: Serialize the entire directory structure and store it in a backup file. You can restore the structure later by deserializing it.
	2.	File System Transfer:
	•	Goal: Move or replicate a directory structure from one system to another.
	•	How: Serialize the directory structure and transfer it to the target system. Deserialize it on the target system to recreate the directory tree.
	3.	Configuration Management:
	•	Goal: Manage complex configurations or project structures.
	•	How: Represent configuration settings or project directories as a tree. Serialize the tree to store configurations or project structures in a configuration file.
	4.	Version Control:
	•	Goal: Track changes to files and directories.
	•	How: In version control systems, each commit can be represented as a snapshot of the file system’s tree structure. Serialize the tree to capture the state of the file system at different points in time.
	5.	Search and Indexing:
	•	Goal: Efficiently search and manage file system data.
	•	How: Represent file system directories and files in a tree structure for indexing. Serialize and store the index for fast search and retrieval.

## Summary

In the context of a file system, each node in the tree can indeed represent a folder or file. By serializing this tree structure, you can save, transfer, or restore the entire directory hierarchy efficiently. This approach is useful for managing, backing up, and transferring file system structures or any hierarchical data.
