## Theory

adaptive IIR equalizer using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm implemented in modern C++. This example demonstrates how to adapt the coefficients of an IIR filter to equalize a signal distorted by a channel.

### AdaptiveIIRFilter Class:
        Constructor: Initializes filter parameters. order is the filter order, and mu is the adaptation step size.
        process() Function: Takes an input sample, processes it through the filter, and returns the output.
        adapt() Function: Updates the filter coefficients based on the LMS algorithm using the error signal.

### Main Function:
        Sets up the filter with specified order and step size.
        Defines simulated received_signal and reference_signal (in real applications, these would be your actual signals).
        Processes each sample of the received signal through the filter and adapts the filter coefficients based on the error between the desired and actual output.

## Note

This example is simplified for clarity. In real-world applications, you would need to handle additional complexities, such as:

    Initialization of coefficients.
    Handling edge cases and signal preprocessing.
    More sophisticated error handling and signal normalization.
    Performance optimizations for large data sets.

Feel free to adapt and extend this example to better suit your specific needs and application requirements.

## IIR theory

Certainly! One common application of IIR filters in mitigating signal distortions introduced by a communication channel is **Equalization**. Equalization is used to correct distortions like amplitude and phase distortions that occur as signals travel through a channel. 

### Example: Adaptive Equalizer using IIR Filters

**Objective:** To compensate for channel distortions in digital communications, such as those caused by multipath fading or frequency-selective fading.

**IIR Filter Type:** **Adaptive IIR Equalizer**

#### Description:
An adaptive IIR equalizer dynamically adjusts its filter coefficients to match the characteristics of the channel distortion. This type of equalizer uses feedback and recursive filtering to dynamically correct the signal as it passes through.

#### Basic Structure:

1. **Filter Structure:**
   The adaptive IIR equalizer typically uses a filter structure with both feedforward (FIR) and feedback (IIR) components. This combination allows it to model a wide range of channel distortions effectively.

   The transfer function of an adaptive IIR filter can be expressed as:
   \[
   H(z) = \frac{B(z)}{A(z)}
   \]
   where:
   - \( B(z) \) is the feedforward polynomial (FIR part)
   - \( A(z) \) is the feedback polynomial (IIR part)

2. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - **Algorithm:** Common algorithms for adapting the filter coefficients include the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm or Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. These algorithms adjust the coefficients based on the difference between the filtered output and the desired signal (reference signal).
   - **Update:** The filter coefficients are updated iteratively to minimize the error between the equalized output and the reference signal, effectively compensating for the distortions introduced by the channel.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Initialization:** Set initial coefficients for the filter.
   - **Filtering:** Apply the adaptive filter to the received signal.
   - **Error Calculation:** Compute the error between the equalized signal and a known reference signal (if available).
   - **Adaptation:** Update the filter coefficients using the adaptation algorithm to reduce the error.
   - **Iteration:** Repeat the filtering and adaptation process as the signal continues to be received.

#### Practical Example:

In a digital communication system, suppose you receive a signal that has been distorted by a frequency-selective fading channel. You can use an adaptive IIR equalizer to correct this distortion.

1. **Setup:**
   - **Received Signal:** \( x[n] \) (distorted signal)
   - **Reference Signal:** \( d[n] \) (desired, undistorted signal)

2. **Filter Design:**
   - Initialize the adaptive IIR filter with an initial guess for the coefficients.
   - Use the filter's output \( y[n] \) to estimate the undistorted signal.

3. **Adaptation:**
   - Compute the error \( e[n] = d[n] - y[n] \).
   - Update the filter coefficients based on \( e[n] \) using an LMS or RLS algorithm.

4. **Output:**
   - The filter’s output, after adaptation, will be a version of the received signal that has been corrected for the distortions introduced by the channel.

This adaptive approach allows the filter to adjust in real-time to varying channel conditions, providing a dynamic solution to compensating for channel distortions.
