## Structure of Arrays" (SoA) and "Array of Structures Theory
    In C++, understanding the performance differences between the "Structure of Arrays" (SoA) and "Array of Structures" (AoS) can be critical for optimizing certain types of programs, especially those that involve large amounts of data processing

    Understanding the performance differences between "Structure of Arrays" (SoA) and "Array of Structures" (AoS) is crucial because it directly impacts the efficiency and speed of memory access and data processing in computer programs, especially in performance-critical applications such as simulations, graphics rendering, and scientific computing. Here are several key reasons why this understanding is important:

1. **Memory Access Patterns**: SoA and AoS represent different ways of organizing data in memory. In AoS, all data members of a single entity (like a struct in C/C++) are contiguous in memory, which can lead to efficient access of all members of that entity but might lead to inefficient memory access patterns when accessing multiple entities due to potential cache misses. SoA, on the other hand, separates different data members into separate arrays, which can improve memory access patterns when accessing multiple entities, potentially reducing cache misses and improving performance.

2. **Vectorization and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: Modern CPUs often leverage SIMD instructions to process multiple data elements simultaneously. SoA can facilitate easier vectorization because data elements that need to be processed together are stored contiguously in memory, aligning with how SIMD operations work. This can lead to significant performance improvements in operations that can be vectorized.

3. **Cache Efficiency**: SoA can improve cache efficiency by ensuring that data accessed together is stored together in memory. This reduces the chance of cache thrashing and improves the locality of reference, which is critical for performance in large datasets where memory access time dominates processing time.

4. **Structural Design for Performance**: Depending on the specific operations performed on the data (e.g., calculations, transformations, queries), choosing between SoA and AoS can optimize the overall performance of the application. Certain operations may be more efficient with AoS, while others may benefit significantly from SoA.

5. **Parallelism and Multithreading**: In concurrent programming scenarios, the choice between SoA and AoS can affect how easily data can be partitioned and processed across multiple threads or processes. SoA can sometimes allow more natural parallelization because different threads can operate on different arrays independently.

6. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Algorithms designed with a specific data layout (SoA or AoS) in mind may exhibit different performance characteristics. Understanding these differences can lead to algorithmic improvements and optimizations tailored to the chosen data layout.

In summary, understanding the performance differences between SoA and AoS is important because it enables developers and engineers to make informed decisions about data layout optimizations, leading to improved performance, reduced memory usage, and better scalability of applications across various hardware platforms and usage scenarios. This understanding is crucial in fields where computational efficiency is paramount, such as high-performance computing, real-time systems, and game development.

## Initialization:
    AoS: We create a vector of ParticleAoS structures and initialize each particle's position and velocity.
    SoA: We create a ParticlesSoA structure containing vectors for each coordinate and initialize them.

### Update Function:
    AoS: updateParticlesAoS updates the positions using the velocities for each particle in the particlesAoS vector.
    SoA: updateParticlesSoA updates the positions using the velocities for each particle in the particlesSoA structure.
### Timing:
    We use std::chrono::high_resolution_clock to measure the time taken to update all particles for both AoS and SoA.

#### Output
    Time taken by AoS: 0.00841062 seconds
    Time taken by SoA: 0.00835908 seconds
